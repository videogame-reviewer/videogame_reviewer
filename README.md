Inside the master branch we have all the code for the Index, CSS and Javascript plus our images. We seperated them by folders for ease as well.

Some things we struggled with was the flex-box with our main objects in the page. We had our car list behind our wheel and it was a huge mess. After a while of researching between
three of us we figured out we needed to add one small line of code. We struggle adding our APIS and not being able to find one for the Chinese Zodiac so we had to code in the Zodiac 
and find an API for the images instead since that was still an issue we were running into since our car information API didn't load pictures. Another thing we couldn't figure out
for a while was adding and making a modal and having it pop up after an error in the input, we eventually found a refrence and that saved out day.

The LunarTuner app is working, you insert your birthyear alongside your name in the input fields. If it's an inncorrect year it will tell you to input a correct year. Next you either press
enter or click the spin button then our wheel spins and shows you your Chinese Zodiac! After that a list of users (if any yet) show up under the input fields and a list of cars specific to
your Chinese Zodiac appear on the right side of your screen!
