# Remote Reviewer
---
Inside the master branch we have all the code for the Handlebars, JavaScript, CSS and our SQL stuff.

Some things we struggled with were making our relationships and our wireframe. We kept thinking we had it down but kept seeing flaws in what we were making. Eventually with all of us putting our heads together we came togther and got it down. We struggled right off the bat with our idea of using an API for the video games data and pictures, either we couldn't get an API that consistently pulled the data we wanted or we couldn't make the API's that could pull them actually work. We were close to maybe doing another idea but then we decided to buckle down and hard code in the data for the games and added in the pictures which took a lot longer than what we anticipated. One last major struggle we had to overcome was near the end almost the last day. We couldn't get our reviews to pop up on our page. We could get the buttons to work but nothing would save in our database besides the comment. We were missing the two biggest things we needed, the user id and the game id. Eventually after hours of struggled we gained help from Lori who helped turn around our entire thinking proccess over the span of multiple hours during the weekend. We eventually after working through it and changing a lot of things and reworking our relationships one last time figured it out.
